## New Features v1.4.0

- Splitted generate_report function in two parts:
  - analise_LR() to only run the analysis without generating the CrossTalkeR report
  - make_report() to only generate a new CrossTalkeR report for existing CrossTalkeR results
- Added node types to the network:
  - we now consider the annotation of a gene as ligand (L) or receptor (R) to consider the biological function 
- Less constrains on the cell cluster name annotation (only '$' must be avoided in the cluster naming)
- Integration with liana-py for ligand-receptor interaction predictions
