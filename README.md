CrossTalkNet aims to provide a user friendly way to visualize cellular crosstalk through ligand receptor networks. It use as input the Ligand Receptor Inference Tool Results to build a sharable report with main network based analysis


## Current Features v0.6.9
- Single and Comparative Reports
   - Cell Cell Interaction visualization
