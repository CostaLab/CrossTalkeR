# Cell-Cell Communication Analysis of Human Myelofibrosis scRNA-seq Data Using CrossTalkeR

Here, we demonstrate the usage of CrossTalkeR on the case study of human myocardian infarction snRNA-seq data from the
Nature paper "Spatial multi-omic map of human myocardial infarction" (Kuppe et al.). 
Aim of the study was to build a high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction to provide a better understanding of these remodelling processes.
We are focusing here on the conditions "myogenic" (control condition) and "ischaemic" (disease condition) and go through the CrossTalkeR results step by step.
